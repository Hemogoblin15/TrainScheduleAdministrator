TrainScheduleAdministrator

TrainScheduleAdministrator is an app that provides information about the status of trains in different stations. It uses XML files as a dataset for the trains and provides the user with the options of updating the arrival times, leave times and multiple other functions. The project was developed using C++ and was made as a task for the Computer Networks course in my second year as a student of the Computer Science Faculty in Iasi.
